The DNA sequence of the gene for the fermentative yeast alcohol dehydrogenase has been determined. The structural gene contains no introns. The amino acid sequence of the protein as determined from the nucleotide sequence disagrees with the published alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme I (ADH-I) sequence for 5 of the 347 amino acid residues. At least one, and perhaps as many as four, of these differences is probably due to ADH-I protein heterogeneity in different yeast strains and not to sequencing errors. S1 nuclease was used to map the 5' and 3' ends of the ADH-I mRNA. There are two discrete, mature 5' ends of the mRNA, mapping 27 and 37 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiating ATG. These two equally prevalent termini are 101 and 91 nucleotides, respectively, downstream from a TATAAA sequence. Analysis of the 3' end of ADH-I mRNA disclosed two minor ends upstream of the major poly(A) addition site. These three ends map 24, 67, and 83 nucleotides, respectively, downstream from the translation-terminating TAA triplet. The sequence AA-TAAG is found 28 to 34 nucleotides upstream of each ADH-I mRNA poly(A) addition site. Sequence comparisons of these three 3' ends with those for four other yeast mRNAs yielded a 13-nucleotide consensus sequence to which TAAATAAGA is central. All of the known yeast poly(A) addition sites map at or near the A residue of a CTA site 25 to 40 nucleotides downstream from this consensus octamer.
