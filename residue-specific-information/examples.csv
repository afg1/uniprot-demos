TRUE,"179,Arginine,dimerization-deficient variant of UreF mutated to alanine,183,tyrosine,dimerization-deficient variant of UreF mutated to aspartate",,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37083535,"To avoid cytotoxicity, ions such as copper and Ni are tightly regulated to subnanomolar concentrations (corresponding to less than one ion per bacterial cell) (26). To activate the urease, the enzyme cannot just pick up free Ni(II) ions from the cytoplasm. Instead, the Ni(II) ions are acquired by metallochaperones such as UreE and UreG and are delivered to the active site of urease within specific protein complexes so that the toxic metal ions do not diffuse into the cytoplasm. After receiving its Ni(II) ions from the UreE2G2 complex (15, 18), Ni-bound UreG activates urease by forming a UreGFD/urease activation complex (17, 20). When Ni-bound UreG was separated from the UreFD/urease complex by a dialysis membrane in a two-chamber dialyzer, the urease activation was abolished (15). This observation suggests that direct protein-protein interaction between UreG and UreFD/urease is essential for Ni delivery from UreG to the urease (15). The dimerization-deficient variant of UreF(R179A/Y183D) failed to form the UreGFD complex and to activate urease in vitro (fig. S11) and in vivo (17), suggesting that UreG delivers its Ni through interaction with the UreFD dimer and the urease. Ni-bound UreG is likely interacting with UreF in the activation complex, as substitutions that break UreG/UreF interaction also abolish urease maturation (16, 27)."
TRUE,"66,Histidine,Binds Ni(II) ion in GTP-bound state of UreG, 68,Histidine,Binds Ni(II) ion in GTP-bound state of UreG",,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37083535,"We have modeled the structure of the HpUreGFD/urease activation complex based on the cryo-EM structure of HpUreFD/urease (this study) and the crystal structure of the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)–bound HpUreGFD complex (fig. S12) (17) to propose a model of how Ni is delivered from UreG to urease (Fig. 4J). A tunnel can be identified in the activation complex that connects the active site of urease to the Ni binding site of UreG (fig. S12). In the GTP-bound state of UreG, the Ni(II) ion is bound at the dimer interface by Cys66 and His68 of the UreG-conserved CPH motif (15). UreG is modeled in the GDP-bound state and may represent the structure of the activation complex immediately after GTP hydrolysis, which disrupts the Ni-binding square-planar coordination ligands (fig. S12). Our mutagenesis and biochemical studies suggest that Ni released from UreG can pass through UreF to UreD to reach the urease buried active site via this tunnel (Fig. 4J)."
FALSE,,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37083535,"In summary, this study shows how cells solve the problem of delivering a toxic metal ion to an essential enzyme by opening a 100-Å-long tunnel within the activation complex so that the toxic Ni(II) ion is delivered through the tunnel to the urease active site. The urease maturation pathway thus provides a paradigm on trafficking of toxic metal ions in cells. The delivery of Ni(II) ions along the urease maturation pathway always occurs within protein complexes so that the toxic metal ions cannot escape into the cytoplasm. In addition to academic curiosity, because H. pylori requires active urease to survive in the acidic environment of human stomach (2), a better understanding of the mechanism of the urease maturation pathway could provide insights into the development of treatment for H. pylori infection (29)."
FALSE,,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37083535,"Urease is a nickel (Ni) enzyme that is essential for the colonization of Helicobacter pylori in the human stomach. To solve the problem of delivering the toxic Ni ion to the active site without diffusing into the cytoplasm, cells have evolved metal carrier proteins, or metallochaperones, to deliver the toxic ions to specific protein complexes. Ni delivery requires urease to form an activation complex with the urease accessory proteins UreFD and UreG. Here, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy structures of H. pylori UreFD/urease and Klebsiella pneumoniae UreD/urease complexes at 2.3- and 2.7-angstrom resolutions, respectively. Combining structural, mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, we show that the formation of the activation complex opens a 100-angstrom-long tunnel, where the Ni ion is delivered through UreFD to the active site of urease."
FALSE,,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37083535,"The urease maturation pathway represents a paradigm for how cells solve the problem of delivering a toxic metal ion to the active site of an essential enzyme. Cells have evolved metallochaperones, or metal carrier proteins, to deliver the Ni(II) ions from one protein to another via the formation of specific protein-protein complexes so that the toxic metal ions do not diffuse into the cytoplasm (9). In the urease maturation pathway, Ni delivery is assisted by four urease accessory proteins UreD, UreE, UreF, and UreG (fig. S1) (9–11). UreE exists as a homodimer in solution containing the conserved Gly-Asn-Arg-His motif that binds a Ni(II) ion at the dimeric interface (12–14). UreG is a GTPase that undergoes guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–dependent dimerization that brings the conserved Cys-Pro-His (CPH) motif to the dimer interface to bind a Ni(II) ion in a square planar coordination (15). UreD interacts with UreF to form a dimer of heterodimeric UreFD complex, which induces conformational changes in UreF to recruit a UreG dimer to form a UreGFD complex (16, 17). UreE provides the upstream source of Ni(II) ions, which are delivered to UreG via the formation of a UreE2G2 heterodimeric complex (15, 18, 19). After receiving its Ni, the Ni-bound UreG dimer forms an activation complex with UreFD and urease, and activates urease upon GTP hydrolysis with the help of UreFD (Fig. 1A) (15, 17, 20)."
FALSE,,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/37083535,"How Ni is transferred from UreG to urease remains elusive. The Ni binding site of urease is deeply buried (3, 4), so it is not known how Ni can access the urease active site. Moreover, because UreG and the urease are topologically separated by the UreFD complex, the Ni binding site of UreG will likely be far away from the urease (Fig. 1A). It is also not known what could be the role of the UreFD complex in this process. In this study, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of H. pylori HpUreFD/urease complex and Klebsiella pneumoniae KpUreD/urease complex. We show that formation of the UreFD/urease complex opens a tunnel from the buried urease active site that can connect to the Ni binding site in UreG. Further supported by mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we suggest that this tunnel facilitates the delivery of Ni(II) ion from UreG to the urease."

It causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which includes fever, vascular hemorrhage, and renal failure. This illness is one of the most serious hemorrhagic diseases in the world, and it is a major public health concern due to its high mortality rate. The Hantaan virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RdRp) is involved in viral RNA transcription and replication for the survival and transmission of this virus. Therefore, it is a primary target for antiviral drug development. Interference with the endonucleolytic ""cap-snatching"" reaction by the HTN virus RdRp endonuclease domain is a particularly appealing approach for drug discovery against this virus. This RdRp endonuclease domain of the HTN virus has a metal-dependent catalytic activity. We targeted this metal-dependent enzymatic activity to identify inhibitors that can bind and disrupt this endonuclease enzyme activity using in-silico approaches i.e., molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, predicted absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET) and drug-likeness studies. The docking studies showed that peramivir, and ingavirin compounds can effectively bind with the manganese ions and engage with other active site residues of this protein. Molecular simulations also showed stable binding of these ligands with the active site of HTN RdRp. Simulation analysis showed that they were in constant contact with the active site manganese ions and amino acid residues of the HTN virus endonuclease domain. This study will help in better understanding the HTN and related viruses."

HTN’s RdRp, in addition to transcriptase and replicase activities, has several other enzymatic activities. The RNA helicase function is among the extra activities of RdRp, on the other hand, it is known to lack the enzymatic activity needed for capping and proofreading [20]. Both positive and negative-strand RNA viruses have a structural polymerase domain that is conserved in RdRp, the same is the case with the HTN RdRp protein. The HTN RdRp core domain's overall structure, which includes a right-handed fold, can be categorized into three sub-domains: thumb, finger, and palm domain. There are four motifs in the HTN RdRp A- to D-, and its polymerase function resides in the motif-C in the palm sub-domain [21]."
FALSE,,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/36376718,"A unique cap-snatching endonuclease domain has certain similarities to the influenza virus endonuclease domain [22]. The cap-snatching activity is essential for starting the RNA polymerase function of the RdRp. To begin the transcription of its vRNA, the HTN virus needs mRNA oligonucleotides, which it uses as a primer to initiate the process of viral transcription. This mRNA primer is provided by the cap-snatching domain, which snatches the mRNA caps from host cell mRNAs along with the endonuclease domain, which cleaves, and processes host mRNAs for viral use at the replication site. The resulting mRNA-capped primers of 10–15 bases are then used for viral mRNA transcription initialization [23]. The HTN virus polymerase snatches the mRNA caps from the host mRNA then cleaves it via its RdRp endonuclease domain and transfers it to the polymerase domain of RdRp. Other viruses i.e. Dengue virus use their capping enzyme to initiate the viral genome synthesis inside its host [24]."

Similarly, other in-silico approaches were used to identify potential anti-viral molecules against this endonuclease domain which can effectively chelate the manganese metal ions and also interact with the active site residues.

The criteria for selecting the compounds used here was their potential for chelating and engaging the ions of the active site. Thus, these compounds can effectively engage and block the catalytic activity of the HTN RdRp enzyme. Previously, several compounds having metal chelating activity with different viruses’ target enzymes have been reported i.e. (Influenza virus and its endonuclease domain inhibitor ‘Xofluza’ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6336199/). Based on these observations, we searched several scholarly online databases. The PubChem database SMILES search option was used to further explore the compounds. Compounds and their derivatives reported for their antiviral activity against several viruses present in the databases, were selected for docking studies. Several related synthesized compounds based on these antiviral compound structures were also retrieved from research articles. In addition, we also utilized several other metal-chelating compounds synthesized by various groups and described in the literature, which had the potential to target this type of viral protein targets.

Pathogenic RAC1 variants result in developmental delay and multiple anomalies. Here, exome sequencing identified a rare de novo RAC1 variant [NM_018890.4:c.118T > C p.(Tyr40His)] in a male patient. Fetal ultrasonography indicated the patient to have multiple anomalies, including persistent left superior vena cava, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, esophageal atresia, scoliosis, and right-hand polydactyly. After birth, craniofacial dysmorphism and esophagobronchial fistula were confirmed and VACTERL association was suspected. One day after birth, the patient died of respiratory failure caused by tracheal aplasia type III. The molecular mechanisms of pathogenic RAC1 variants remain largely unclear; therefore, we biochemically examined the pathophysiological significance of RAC1-p.Tyr40His by focusing on the best characterized downstream effector of RAC1, PAK1, which activates Hedgehog signaling. RAC1-p.Tyr40His interacted minimally with PAK1, and did not enable PAK1 activation. Variants in the RAC1 Switch II region consistently activate downstream signals, whereas the p.Tyr40His variant at the RAC1-PAK1 binding site and adjacent to the Switch I region may deactivate the signals. It is important to accumulate data from individuals with different RAC1 variants to gain a full understanding of their varied clinical presentations."

Rac1 knockout mice were embryonic lethal due to the failure in formation of the three germ layers during gastrulation resulting in congenital heart defects3,4. As a small GTPase, RAC1 cycles between active/GTP-bound states and inactive/guanosine diphosphate(GDP)-bound states via conformational changes mainly in the Switch I (amino acids 25–39) and Switch II (amino acids 57–75) regions5. The GTP/GDP-bound states are controlled by various guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). While GEFs facilitate GDP release and GTP loading to activate GTPases, GAPs enhance intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis to inactivate GTPases6.

TRUE,"20,Lysine,Methylated position of hustone H4",,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/36897941,"Histone methylases and demethylases are increasingly being found to play a role in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders (1–4). These proteins add and remove methyl groups to histones H3 and H4 to alter transcription (5–7). Histone methylation can cause either transcriptional activation or suppression depending on which residue is methylated (4). Disruptive variants in lysine methyl transferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs) lead to various neurodevelopmental syndromes that share similar phenotypes including developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), and craniofacial anomalies (4, 8–11). Computational analysis (12) and large-scale sequencing studies have highlighted the importance of the lysine methyltransferase gene, KMT5B, in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders (11, 13–16). KMT5B (OMIM: 610881), also denominated suppressor of variegation 4-20 (SUV420H1), is located on chromosome 11q13.2 and contains 13 exons (17). The encoded protein has an N domain (pre-SET domain), a catalytic SET domain, and a C domain with a Zn binding site (post-SET domain) (18). Few disruptive variants in the general population have been reported in the catalytic domain, suggesting that this region is critical for proper protein function. KMT5 family members methylate histone H4 at lysine-20 (K20), which can occur in three different states mono- (H4K20me1), di- (H4K20me2), or trimethylated (H4K20me3). Increasing methylation causes increased chromatin compaction and repression of transcription (19). Evidence suggests that different methylases are responsible for each methylation state of H4K20 (KMT5A for H4K20me1, KMT5B for H4K20me2, and KMT5C for H4K20me3) (18). An additional role for KMT5B-H4K20me2 has been proposed in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks, through the nonhomologous end joining mechanism (18, 20)."

Clinical features reported include ID, autism spectrum disorder, DD, macrocephaly, febrile seizures, hypotonia, attention deficits, failure to thrive, sleep problems, tall stature, gastrointestinal issues, and characteristic facial features (11, 14, 16, 18, 21). Similar to other KMTs and KDMs, haploinsufficiency has been proposed as the most likely pathogenic mechanism for KMT5B (11); although, functional studies remain limited. The Allen BrainSpan Atlas (22) shows that peak human brain KMT5B mRNA expression occurs before 20 weeks after conception, falling after birth to a steady state (18). However, a detailed time course of KMT5B expression in model systems is lacking. Loss of KMT5B results in altered development of both the brain and cardiopulmonary system (23, 24). Evidence of KMT5B’s role in neurogenesis is available for many models [zebrafish (25, 26), amphibian (27), rodent (28), and primate (29) model systems]. These studies suggest that proper H4K20 methylation is necessary for typical neurodevelopment (18, 22), although further research is necessary to elucidate the pathways affected by pathogenic KMT5B variants in humans."

In our cohort, nine patients had frameshift variants, two had partial deletions, one had a deletion of a single amino acid, 11 had nonsense variants, three had splice site variants, and 16 had missense variants (Fig. 2A). Most of the missense variants were in the SET domain. Human population-level genetic data [gnomAD (Genome Aggregation Database)] show that pLOF variation in KMT5B is highly constrained (i.e., extremely rare; LOF pLI = 1.00) but that some level of missense variation may be tolerated (Z = 2.79). This is likely domain specific with less variation tolerated within the SET domain. The missense variants in our study were in regions that are highly conserved (Fig. 4A).
